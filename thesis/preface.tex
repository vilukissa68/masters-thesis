\noindent This work was made in the SoC Hub research group at Tampere University as a paid research assistant.

\noindent I would like to thank my supervisors Henri Lunnikivi and Timo Hämäläinen for their guidance during this Thesis. Special thanks for Henri for his technical knowledge, without which the project would not have been a success.

\noindent I would also like to thank the rest of my colleagues at SoC Hub for providing great insights and support, especially Antti Nurmi for his help with understanding the ins and outs of the Deep Learning Accelerator, and Andreas Stregiopoulos for his great work with the Newlib port. SoC Hub as allowed me to pursue this interesting topic, and I've been able to learn from the great minds working there, and for that I'm extremely grateful.

\noindent Finally, I thank my family and friends for giving me their support and patience during this project and for the rest of my time in the university.
