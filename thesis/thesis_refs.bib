% E.g. emacs is good for editing this file 
% because is has a separate bibtex mode which 
% gives additional menus for adding new refs.
%
% Put 'and' between author names!
% Use braces to get capital letters correctly in titles, 
%  e.g {System-on-Chip}.
% Use 'and others' to produce 'et al.' in your bibliography.
% The order does not matter for bibtex compilation 
%  (but affects understandability).

% Example of journal artcile
% --------------------------
% In Latex doc, type \cite{ref_id} to add ref to this record. 
% ref_id is of type <Firstauthor><Year><Letter>
% <Firstauthor> = last name of first author, e.g. salminen
% <Year>        = two numbers, e.g. 03
% <Letter>      = 'running number' to distinquish several refs of
%                 one author on a given year, start with a
% use only small case letters and no white spaces, e.g. salminen03a

  abstract = {There is an increasing need to bring machine learning to a wide diversity of hardware devices. Current frameworks rely on vendor-specific operator libraries and optimize for a narrow range of server-class GPUs. Deploying workloads to new platforms - such as mobile phones, embedded devices, and accelerators (e.g., FPGAs, ASICs) - requires significant manual effort. We propose TVM, a compiler that exposes graph-level and operator-level optimizations to provide performance portability to deep learning workloads across diverse hardware back-ends. TVM solves optimization challenges specific to deep learning, such as high-level operator fusion, mapping to arbitrary hardware primitives, and memory latency hiding. It also automates optimization of low-level programs to hardware characteristics by employing a novel, learning-based cost modeling method for rapid exploration of code optimizations. Experimental results show that TVM delivers performance across hardware back-ends that are competitive with state-of-the-art, hand-tuned libraries for low-power CPU, mobile GPU, and server-class GPUs. We also demonstrate TVM's ability to target new accelerator back-ends, such as the FPGA-based generic deep learning accelerator. The system is open sourced and in production use inside several major companies.},
